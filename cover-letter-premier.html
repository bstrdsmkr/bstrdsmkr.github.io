      <h4 class="yellow" id="greeting">Dear Mr. Isaac and the team at Gridsmart,</h4>
      <p>I have been speaking with the folks at Premier Staffing regarding your need for a DevOps Engineer and I'd like to introduce myself and learn more about your team. Technology has been my passion since I began learning Javascript as a teenager and today I am fortunate enough to make a living practicing my art and doing what I love.</p>
      <p>Through my work at Oak Ridge National Lab, I have been able to contribute to many different teams and grow my skills in many different areas including Linux systems administration, big data pipelines, software and hardware architecture, and leading workshops in CI/CD and version control best practices.</p>
      <p>Once the opportunity arose to hone my skills as a developer, I moved on to the fast paced world of startups. While there, I made some life long friends and learned much more about their entirely AWS based infrastucture. Unfortunately, not every great idea can be the next big thing and so I find myself looking for what is next for me.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reviewing my resume and I look forward to the opportunity to meet your team to discuss your needs and how I can help.</p>
